# 🎮 Beta Games

Welcome to **Beta Games** --- an offline X and O (Tic-Tac-Toe) game
built with **TypeScript**.

Beta Games is designed to run completely offline, with all logic handled
locally in the application. It features structured game components,
clean architecture, and scalable AI logic for multiple difficulty
levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 About The App

**Beta Games** is a modern, offline X and O game built using:

-   TypeScript
-    JAVA - Handling the logic of the frontend design of XML
-    XML - android app design UI
-   Component-based architecture
-   Local game logic (no server required)
-   Fully offline functionality

All game decisions --- including player moves, AI calculations, win
detection, and draw detection --- are handled locally within the
application.

## 🧠 Offline Logic System

This game works completely offline.

✔ No API calls\
✔ No backend server\
✔ No database\
✔ Internet connection required to Open the app
✔ No internet connection required to play the games

Once the page has loaded the logic and the game execution is stored on the app.
All logic is stored and executed inside:

    services/gameLogic.ts

The AI logic includes:

-   Win detection algorithm\
-   Block opponent strategy\
-   Priority move selection\
-   Smart move evaluation\
-   Difficulty level scaling
